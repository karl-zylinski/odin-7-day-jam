Note: This file assumes the existence of a type Rect that defines a rectangle in the same package, it can defined as:

	Rect :: rl.Rectangle

or if you don't use raylib:

	Rect :: struct {
		x, y, width, height: f32,
	}

or if you want to use integers (or any other numeric type):

	Rect :: struct {
		x, y, width, height: int,
	}

Just make sure you have something along those lines the same package as this file.
